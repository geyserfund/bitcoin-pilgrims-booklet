The Bitcoin Pilgrim Booklet is an open source project and initiative. It was started to encourage more Bitcoiners to visit circular economies, meet-ups and events pushing grassroots Bitcoin adoption forward. To read more about the project check out the [Bitcoin Pilgrims](bitcoinpilgrims.com) website.

This repository is intended mainly for event organisers and community leaders. It contains all the necessary files and instructions to print out your own booklet and stamp.

## Resources

### Circular Economy Stamp

We encourage each event organisers and community leaders to design their own stamp, reflecting the uniqueness of each event or circular economy. If you're just getting started, this repository also contains a generic "Circular Economy" stamp, ie: `generic-stamp.stl` and a generic design file `generic-stamp.svg`. Both files can be used, downloaded and mofidied freely.

## Stamping Guidelines

Each page in the booklet has 6 stamp slots. Community members are responsible for stamping the booklet of visitors, using the 3D printed or custom stamp.

_Pro Tip:_ write down the community name and block height to record where and when the stamp was placed.
