The Bitcoin Pilgrim Booklet is an open source project and initiative. It was started to encourage more Bitcoiners to visit circular economies, meet-ups and events pushing grassroots Bitcoin adoption forward.

This repository is intended mainly for event organisers and community leaders. It contains all the necessary files and instructions to print out your own booklet and stamp.

## Circular Economy Stamp

We encourage each event organisers and community leaders to design their own stamp, reflecting the uniqueness of each event or circular economy. If you're just getting started, this repository also contains a generic "Circular Economy" stamp, ie: `circular-economy.stl`. That file can be used, downloaded and mofidied freely.
